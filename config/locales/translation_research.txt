There are several options how to determine and persist a language setting for the user:
  * setting the language from the domain name, e.g. example.en , example.de , example.pl
  * setting the language from url parameters, e.g. example.com?locale=en , example.com?locale=de
  * setting the language from client supplied information
    - using the accept language header from the browser
    - using geo IP, e.g. query the users IP address
    - user profile, e.g. the user saves the preffered language in his settings
